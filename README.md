# Machine Learning for Sign Language translation
Nowadays HCI are increasingly oriented to NLP, we have chatbots and virtual assistants that work with voice.

Unfortunately, these technologies do not take into account people with vocal disabilities or aphonia.
The proposal is a project to improve human-computer interaction through the translation of sign language, in which a video sequence of symbolic gestures with the hands is translated into written language.
